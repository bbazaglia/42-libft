This is the first project required by the Software Engineering School '42'. 
We were asked to create our own standard C library in which we implement functions that will be used along the curriculum.

Disclaimer:
The main purpose of this repository is to expose my codes and help other students to understsnd what was done in each function. 
Therefore, this work should be used for academic reasons, by those who aim to learn, and not merely copy.
